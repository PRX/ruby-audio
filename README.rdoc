= ruby-audio

Gemified release of ruby/audio. ruby-audio wraps around libsndfile to provide
simplified sound reading and writing support to ruby programs. The core is the
Audio::Sound class, which is a subclass of NArray. Also provided is the
Audio::Soundfile class, which is a wrapper around the wonderful libsndfile.

== About This Release

Since it wasn't being maintained, I've taken it under my wing to get it usable.
Please contact me with any questions or comments.
