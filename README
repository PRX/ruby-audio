= ruby/audio

This module and its classes are provided for the purpose of aiding in the
manipulation of audio data. The core is the Audio::Sound class, which is a
subclass of NArray. Also provided is the Audio::Soundfile class, which is a
wrapper around the wonderful libsndfile. 

== About This Release

This is the initial release of ruby/audio. The API can be considered relatively
stable, barring the discovery of fundamental design flaws. More methods may be
added, but backwards compatibility will be strived for. However, if you rely on
the existing API and would like to ensure compatibility, drop me a line. If I
know people are using it, I will be more careful not to break things. 

*Please* send me feedback if you find a bug, find the API awkward, or just
like/hate it.

Next on my list is to wrap libsamplerate, adapt
ladspar[http://rubyforge.org/projects/ladspar] to use Audio::Sound, and perhaps
wrap portaudio.
